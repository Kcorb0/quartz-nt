# Markdown cross platform notes app

Memory that lasts forever.

#### What's the problem?

Markdown is extremely useful for writing comprehensive notes, but can be scary to use for a non programmer.

The issue is there are already apps that do this, such as obsidian and Notion, but with both of these apps there is still a need to learn a fairly large amount before actually getting into writing. 

#### Key Solutions

1. Accessability: from opening the app it should be stated what markdown is and how it can be used in basic ways, headers, page links, maths and images should be the first things made clear.

1. Recommendations: or insights could be shown in a panel of to the side to help the user write with a quick reference.

1. Minimal Design: features can be enabled but the basic functionality should be note taking, easy navigation and preview.

1. Editing: preview and editing should be easy to toggle between

1. Needs to be very convenient to find different pages.


#### Feature Ideas

- Popout markdown preview, or popout multiple pages to their own window.
